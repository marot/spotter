- Selected sessions: 6
- Selected subagent files: 12
- Selection rule: top 6 by line count, force at least one subagent-capable session when available
- Sanitization: usernames, emails, signature values, and common token patterns are redacted

## Transcript Shape Notes

- Assistant token usage is under `message.usage` (for example `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`).
- Read/snippet results may include `toolUseResult.file.startLine`, `toolUseResult.file.numLines`, and `toolUseResult.file.totalLines`.
- User-facing tool-result text can still include inline `N→` prefixes even when `toolUseResult.file.startLine` exists.
- Parent-session Task calls can define subagent type via `{"name":"Task","input":{"subagent_type":"..."}}`.
- Progress messages link agent IDs to Task tool calls via `data.type == "agent_progress"`, `data.agentId`, and `parentToolUseID`.
- Subagent transcript files do not reliably include Task metadata, so parent-session correlation is required for `subagent_type`.
