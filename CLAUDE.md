# Product
Spotter helps to review Claude Code sessions and generated code. 

# Architecture
Ash, Phoenix, LiveView, xterm.js, tmux

The prototype runs on localhost, and has no authentication.

This project is greenfield. No legacy fallbacks, backwards compatability or similar is needed.

# Worktrees

## Daily workflow
git gtr new my-feature          # Create worktree folder: my-feature

## Run commands in worktree
git gtr run my-feature npm test # Run tests

## Navigate to worktree
gtr cd my-feature               # Requires: eval "$(git gtr init bash)"
cd "$(git gtr go my-feature)"   # Alternative without shell integration

## List all worktrees
git gtr list

## Remove when done
git gtr rm my-feature

## Or remove all worktrees with merged PRs/MRs (requires gh or glab CLI)
git gtr clean --merged

# Commit Linking

Sessions are linked to Git commits via hooks (deterministic, confidence 1.0) and async enrichment (inferred, confidence 0.60-0.90). Hook scripts must stay under 200ms and never call `git show` or `git patch-id`. See README for full details.

# Tracing Infrastructure

OpenTelemetry tracing is core infrastructure in Spotter. Do not remove instrumentation or disable tracing by default.

- Plugin/hook HTTP calls must preserve tracing metadata headers:
  - `traceparent` (when available)
  - `x-spotter-hook-event`
  - `x-spotter-hook-script`
- Hook scripts must remain non-blocking and fail-safe (silent failure is preferred over blocking Claude).
- `SPOTTER_OTEL_ENABLED=false` is only for local troubleshooting.

## Where manual tracing is required

Add manual spans where instrumentation is not automatic (Bandit/Phoenix/Ash cover common paths):

- Hook/controller business logic boundaries and explicit error branches
- Oban jobs and other background/async enrichment workers
- LiveView custom telemetry handlers and event-specific logic
- Phoenix Channels and stream lifecycle events (join/input/resize/stream start/stop)
- `Task`/`Task.Supervisor` boundaries and external service calls

## How to add manual tracing

- Controllers: wrap logic with `SpotterWeb.OtelTraceHelpers.with_span`.
- Jobs/services/channels: use `OpenTelemetry.Tracer.with_span`.
- Add structured attributes with `OpenTelemetry.Tracer.set_attribute/2`.
- Record failures with `OpenTelemetry.Tracer.set_status(:error, reason)` (or `SpotterWeb.OtelTraceHelpers.set_error/2` where applicable).
- Hook endpoints should set `x-spotter-trace-id` via `SpotterWeb.OtelTraceHelpers.put_trace_response_header/1`.

# Agent Instructions

- Do not ignore credo lintings. Fix them.
- If commiting on a branch, always push to remote too.

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd list --status=closed --type=epic # See closed epics (worktrees)
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Merging a NAME worktree
Rebase the target branch onto main (not main onto target branch)
Merge the target branch with fast-forward 
Afterwards cleanup the branch and worktree (git gtr rm NAME) 
Cleanup tmux session: tmux kill-session -t spotter-NAME

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
