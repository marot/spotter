The pane detail view uses pane_id as its primary key, but session_id is the real identifier. There's no way to interactively review a past session transcript.\n\n## Solution\n1. Filter dashboard to only show panes registered via the spotter-plugin (known session_id).\n2. Change the detail route from `/panes/:pane_id` to `/sessions/:session_id`. The view finds the tmux pane from the session_id (via SessionRegistry for live sessions, or by tmux session name for review sessions).\n3. Add click-to-review: clicking a transcript session row launches `claude --resume \u003cid\u003e --fork-session` in a named tmux session (`spotter-review-\u003cshort-id\u003e`) and navigates to `/sessions/:session_id` immediately (loading state until tmux is ready).\n4.

There is no automatic propagation.\n\n## Solution\n\nIntroduce ash_computer (reactive computation DSL) to replace scattered state management with three declarative computers defined inline in PaneListLive:\n\n1. **ProjectFilter computer** - Manages project list and selected project filter. When selected_project_id changes, dependent computers recompute automatically.\n2. **SessionPagination computer** - Manages cursor-based pagination for visible/hidden sessions per project. Replaces 4+ pagination assigns per project with reactive vals.\n3. **ToolCallStats computer** - Loads error counts per session reactively when session_ids change. Replaces separate load_tool_call_stats phase.\n\nAll Ash.read calls in computer vals wrapped in try/catch to return nil/[] on error instead of crashing.\n\n## Acceptance Tests\n\n- GIVEN PaneListLive mounts WHEN ash_computer is integrated THEN all three computers initialize via mount_computers(socket) and projects display correctly\n- GIVEN a user clicks a project filter chip WHEN the filter_project event fires THEN SessionPagination recomputes with sessions for only that project\n- GIVEN sessions are loaded WHEN user clicks Load More THEN pagination cursor updates and new sessions append without full page reload\n- GIVEN sessions are loaded WHEN ToolCallStats computer observes session_ids THEN error counts display correctly per session (total and failed)\n- GIVEN an Ash.read query fails WHEN a computer val recomputes THEN the val returns nil/[] and the template renders empty state (no LiveView crash)\n- GIVEN the refactored PaneListLive WHEN user navigates to Review THEN SessionLive loads correctly (no regression)\n\n## Rabbit Holes\n\n- Pagination state for visible vs hidden sessions per project may require careful input modeling (compound inputs or separate computers). Start with a single SessionPagination computer with visibility_type input.\n- ash_computer event macro may conflict with existing Phoenix helpers.

The `pagination_keys/1` helper exists solely to avoid hardcoding these field names. The `append_session_page/3` and `do_append_session_page/4` functions manually update these fields on the correct project in the list. This scattered state is hard to follow and error-prone.\n\nAn ash_computer computer can model this as reactive vals that recompute when project_id or pagination inputs change.\n\n## Output files\n\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/pane_list_live.ex` — Define `computer :session_data` block, remove `load_projects/1`, `append_session_page/3`, `do_append_session_page/4`, `pagination_keys/1` helpers, update template\n\n## Technical specs\n\nThe challenge is that pagination state is per-project AND per-visibility (visible/hidden). ash_computer works best with a single set of inputs → vals. Two approaches:\n\n**Approach A (recommended): Single computer that loads all project data**\n\nDefine a computer whose input is the full project list (from ProjectFilter), and whose val computes the enriched project data including sessions and pagination:\n\n```elixir\ncomputer :session_data do\n  input :project_ids do\n    initial []\n    description \"List of project IDs to load sessions for\"\n  end\n\n  input :pagination_state do\n    initial %{}\n    description \"Map of {project_id, visibility} =\u003e cursor for keyset pagination\"\n  end\n\n  val :enriched_projects do\n    description \"Projects with visible/hidden sessions and pagination metadata\"\n    compute fn %{project_ids: project_ids, pagination_state: pagination_state} -\u003e\n      try do\n        Enum.map(project_ids, fn project_id -\u003e\n          {visible, visible_meta} = load_project_sessions(project_id, :visible,\n            after: Map.get(pagination_state, {project_id, :visible}))\n          {hidden, hidden_meta} = load_project_sessions(project_id, :hidden,\n            after: Map.get(pagination_state, {project_id, :hidden}))\n\n          %{\n            project_id: project_id,\n            visible_sessions: visible,\n            hidden_sessions: hidden,\n            visible_has_more: visible_meta.has_more,\n            visible_cursor: visible_meta.next_cursor,\n            hidden_has_more: hidden_meta.has_more,\n            hidden_cursor: hidden_meta.next_cursor\n          }\n        end)\n      rescue\n        _ -\u003e []\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  event :load_more do\n    handle fn %{pagination_state: state}, %{\"project-id\" =\u003e pid, \"visibility\" =\u003e vis} -\u003e\n      visibility = String.to_existing_atom(vis)\n      # This needs to accumulate sessions, not replace them.\n      # May need stateful approach or manual update_computer_inputs\n      %{pagination_state: Map.put(state, {pid, visibility}, new_cursor)}\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n**Important consideration**: The load_more pattern requires appending sessions (not replacing). This may require:\n- Using `stateful? true` to access previous vals\n- Or using `update_computer_inputs/3` in a custom handle_event to accumulate sessions outside the computer\n- Or tracking accumulated sessions in a separate assign alongside the computer\n\nEvaluate which approach works cleanest during implementation. The key constraint is: existing sessions must be preserved when loading more.\n\n## Source references\n\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/pane_list_live.ex` lines 128-189 (load_projects, append_session_page, do_append_session_page, pagination_keys)\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/pane_list_live.ex` lines 191-212 (load_project_sessions — this function stays, it's the underlying query builder)\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/pane_list_live.ex` lines 65-73 (load_more_sessions handle_event)\n\n## Edge cases\n\n- **Accumulating sessions on load_more**: The current code appends new sessions (`Map.update!(keys.sessions, \u0026(\u00261 ++ new_sessions))`). A computer val that recomputes from scratch won't accumulate. Need stateful approach or hybrid.\n- **Initial load vs load_more**: On mount, all projects load their first page. On load_more, only one project's one visibility type gets appended.\n- **Error handling**: Wrap Ash.read in try/rescue. Return [] for that project's sessions on error.\n- **@sessions_per_page**: Keep the existing constant (20) for pagination limit.\n\n## Architecture constraints\n\n- Keep `load_project_sessions/3` as a regular private function (it builds the Ash query and calls Ash.read!)\n- Template must still render per-project with visible/hidden sections\n- PubSub sync_completed handler currently calls `load_projects(socket)` — need to update this to trigger computer recomputation instead (use `update_computer_inputs/3`)\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] All requirements in the task description are implemented\n- [ ] Pagination state no longer scattered across project map fields\n- [ ] `pagination_keys/1` helper removed\n- [ ] `append_session_page/3` and `do_append_session_page/4` removed or simplified\n- [ ] Load More button works: appends sessions without losing existing ones\n- [ ] Initial page load shows first 20 sessions per project per visibility\n- [ ] Template updated to reference computer vals\n- [ ] `mix compile` and `mix credo` pass","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"marco.rotili@handgemacht.ai","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:49:54.522659455+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili","updated_at":"2026-02-11T23:32:07.132531034+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T23:32:07.132531034+01:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"spotter-65u.3","depends_on_id":"spotter-65u","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:49:54.525295938+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili"},{"issue_id":"spotter-65u.3","depends_on_id":"spotter-65u.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:51:01.455419858+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili"}]}

Use a single val with conditional logic:\n\n```elixir\nval :stats do\n  compute fn %{session_ids: session_ids} -\u003e\n    if session_ids == [] do\n      %{}\n    else\n      try do\n        Spotter.Transcripts.ToolCall\n        |\u003e Ash.Query.filter(session_id in ^session_ids)\n        |\u003e Ash.read\\!()\n        |\u003e Enum.group_by(\u0026 \u00261.session_id)\n        |\u003e Map.new(fn {sid, calls} -\u003e\n          failed = Enum.count(calls, \u0026 \u00261.is_error)\n          {sid, %{total: length(calls), failed: failed}}\n        end)\n      rescue\n        _ -\u003e %{}\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nAfter the session_data computer recomputes (from task spotter-65u.3), extract all session IDs and call `update_computer_inputs(socket, :tool_call_stats, %{session_ids: all_ids})` to trigger stats recomputation.\n\nTemplate reference changes from `@tool_call_stats` to `@tool_call_stats_stats`.\n\n## Component usage\n\n- `require Ash.Query` — Already present in PaneListLive\n- `Spotter.Transcripts.ToolCall` — Already aliased\n\n## Source references\n\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/pane_list_live.ex` lines 214-234 (load_tool_call_stats, load_tool_call_stats_for)\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/pane_list_live.ex` lines 329-337, 406-414 (template stats display — both visible and hidden tables use same pattern)\n\n## Edge cases\n\n- **Empty session_ids**: Return empty map (no query needed)\n- **Large session lists**: Current code loads all ToolCalls for all sessions and groups in memory. This is existing behavior — not changing it here, but worth noting as a future optimization (use Ash aggregates instead).\n- **Error handling**: Wrap in try/rescue to return %{} on error. Template already handles missing stats with \"—\" fallback.\n- **Merge vs replace**: Currently load_more merges new stats into existing map (`Map.merge(socket.assigns.tool_call_stats, new_stats)`). With reactive computer, stats recompute for all current session_ids at once, so no merge needed — but this means reloading stats for sessions we already had. Accept this trade-off for simplicity; optimize later if needed.\n\n## Architecture constraints\n\n- Stats computer has no events (pure reactive data load)\n- Triggered by updating session_ids input from outside (after session_data computer updates)\n- Template uses cond for display logic — keep same pattern, just change assign name\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] All requirements in the task description are implemented\n- [ ] `load_tool_call_stats/1` and `load_tool_call_stats_for/1` removed\n- [ ] Stats computer val recomputes when session_ids input changes\n- [ ] Template displays tool call counts correctly (total and failed)\n- [ ] Empty session list returns empty stats (no error)\n- [ ] `mix compile` and `mix credo` pass","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"marco.rotili@handgemacht.ai","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:50:21.315475796+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili","updated_at":"2026-02-11T23:36:45.874592221+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T23:36:45.874592221+01:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"spotter-65u.4","depends_on_id":"spotter-65u","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:50:21.322064047+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili"},{"issue_id":"spotter-65u.4","depends_on_id":"spotter-65u.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-11T22:51:01.785438787+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili"}]}

{"id":"spotter-8yj","title":"Graphite UI Rework: Unified Dark Design System","description":"## Problem\nSpotter's UI is built with inline styles scattered across 6 LiveView modules and a light-themed transcript panel CSS file. There is no design system: colors, spacing, typography, and component patterns are ad-hoc and inconsistent. The transcript panel uses a light theme (#f8fafc background) that clashes with the dark terminal and sidebar panels. The dashboard uses raw HTML tables with inline styles. Navigation is a minimal top bar with two links. Code syntax highlighting uses a GitHub-light theme that is unreadable against the dark surroundings. There is a dead /debug route. The result is a prototype that works but feels unpolished and hard to navigate.\n\n## Solution\nImplement the \"Graphite\" design system - a unified dark theme with layered surfaces, semantic accent colors, consistent typography (Bricolage Grotesque for UI, JetBrains Mono for code), and reusable CSS classes. Execute in 9 sequential tasks:\n1. Design system foundation: CSS custom properties, base element styles, font loading, grain texture\n2. Navigation \u0026 layout shell: sidebar nav replacing top bar, breadcrumbs\n3. Dashboard redesign (PaneListLive): cards, filters, project grouping\n4. Session review redesign (SessionLive): unified dark panels, tabbed sidebar\n5. Subagent view redesign (SubagentLive): consistent with session view\n6. Commit history redesign (HistoryLive): improved card layout and filters\n7. Project review redesign (ProjectReviewLive): better annotation list\n8. Remove debug terminal (DebugTerminalLive + /debug route)\n9. Dark syntax highlighting theme replacing GitHub-light hljs styles\n\n## Acceptance Tests\n- GIVEN the design system foundation is applied WHEN any page loads THEN all surfaces use the Graphite palette (#0c0e14 through #2d3344), no inline color literals remain in HEEx templates, and Bricolage Grotesque renders for UI text\n- GIVEN the sidebar navigation is implemented WHEN user is on any page THEN a compact left sidebar shows Dashboard and History links with the active page highlighted\n- GIVEN the session review redesign is complete WHEN /sessions/:id loads THEN all three panels use dark backgrounds, transcript rows have semantic left-border accents, and the right sidebar has Commits/Annotations/Errors tabs\n- GIVEN the debug terminal is removed WHEN user navigates to /debug THEN they receive a 404\n- GIVEN the dark syntax highlighting is applied WHEN a code block renders THEN it uses light-on-dark colors readable against surface-1\n\n## Rabbit Holes\n- Over-engineering a component library: keep it to CSS classes and simple HEEx, not a full design system package\n- Responsive/mobile: Spotter runs on localhost, just ensure nothing breaks at 1024px+\n- CSS-in-JS or Tailwind migration: stay with plain CSS custom properties\n- Accessibility audit: respect contrast ratios but do not scope a full WCAG audit\n\n## No-gos\n- Do not change any Elixir business logic, Ash resources, or data models\n- Do not modify xterm.css (vendor file)\n- Do not add new npm dependencies beyond the Google Fonts link\n- Do not change the Phoenix channel/WebSocket terminal architecture\n- Do not refactor JS hooks beyond theme config and highlight.js theme swap\n\n---\nRig: spotter.

Make `ProjectReviewLive` launch tests deterministic.\n- Remove the nondeterministic assertion:\n  - `assert html =~ \\\"review session\\\" or html =~ \\\"Failed to launch\\\"`\n- Replace with fake-backed explicit success/failure tests using `:fake_tmux_launch_result`.\n\n3. Ensure `FakeTmux` supports every launch API used by tests.\n- Keep `launch_project_review/3`.\n- Add `launch_review_session/2` if any test path needs it.\n- Record calls so tests can assert launch invocation without touching tmux.\n\n4.

Without this task, reviewers still cannot inspect raw JSON context quickly or expand truncated outputs in-place.\n\n## Output Files\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/session_live.ex`\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/subagent_live.ex`\n- `lib/spotter_web/components/transcript_components.ex`\n- `assets/js/app.js`\n- `assets/test/highlight-integration.test.js`\n- `priv/static/assets/spotter.css`\n- `test/spotter_web/live/session_live_test.exs`\n- `test/spotter_web/live/subagent_live_test.exs`\n\n## Technical Specs\n- Debug sidecar parity:\n  - Support `show_debug` toggle in both `SessionLive` and `SubagentLive`.\n  - When debug is ON, render row content and row JSON side-by-side for every transcript row.\n  - Pretty-print each row payload with `Jason.encode!(line.debug_payload, pretty: true)` and render inside `\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-json\"\u003e...\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e`.\n  - Keep existing keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+D`) for debug toggle and ensure it works on subagent page too.\n- Expandable tool-result groups:\n  - Respect renderer metadata (`tool_result_group`, `hidden_by_default`, `result_total_lines`).\n  - Default state: first 10 lines visible per group.\n  - Render button text exactly:\n    - collapsed: `Show N more lines`\n    - expanded: `Show less`\n  - Add LiveView event `toggle_tool_result_group` that updates `expanded_tool_groups` in the shared computer inputs.\n  - Expanding/collapsing must not reset annotation selection state.\n- Highlighter integration:\n  - Keep highlight.js as the only syntax highlighter.\n  - Extend highlighter hook to highlight both transcript code blocks and debug JSON blocks.\n  - Ensure this runs on mount and update without double-highlighting (`data-hljs=\"done\"` guard remains).\n- Shared component usage:\n  - Session and subagent pages must render transcript rows through the same shared component functions.\n  - No duplicate debug-row HTML or expand-button HTML in per-page LiveView modules.\n- Styling and layout:\n  - Add transcript debug grid classes and expand-control styles in `priv/static/assets/spotter.css`.\n  - Desktop: two-column row layout (rendered text + JSON payload).\n  - Mobile: stacked layout with readable spacing and no horizontal overflow.\n  - UI styling changes must follow AGENTS.md Frontend Tasks guidance (frontend design skill reference).\n\n## Component Usage\n- Use `SpotterWeb.TranscriptComponents.transcript_panel/1` from both LiveViews.\n- Use one JS hook entrypoint for transcript selection + code/json highlighting + jump/annotation behaviors.\n\n## Source References\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/session_live.ex`\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/subagent_live.ex`\n- `lib/spotter_web/components/transcript_components.ex`\n- `assets/js/app.js`\n- `assets/test/highlight-integration.test.js`\n- `priv/static/assets/spotter.css`\n\n## Edge Cases\n- Empty transcript still renders empty-state text in both views.\n- If `debug_payload` cannot be encoded, render safe fallback JSON string instead of crashing LiveView.\n- Expand control appears only for groups with hidden lines (`result_total_lines \u003e 10`).\n- Debug toggle does not break `highlight_transcript_annotation` behavior.\n\n## Architecture Constraints\n- Keep expansion state server-authoritative in LiveView assigns/computer inputs; do not rely on client-only hidden DOM state.\n- Do not introduce a separate “subagent-only” debug path.\n- Do not replace highlight.js.\n\n## Definition Of Done\n- Both transcript pages show identical debug-sidecar behavior and expand/collapse controls.\n- Tool-result truncation is explicit and user-expandable (10-line default visible budget).\n- highlight.js covers transcript code and debug JSON blocks without regression.\n- LiveView and JS tests cover debug rendering, expand interaction, and subagent parity.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"marco.rotili@handgemacht.ai","created_at":"2026-02-12T16:47:44.066777942+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili","updated_at":"2026-02-12T21:33:53.783437944+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-12T21:33:53.783437944+01:00","close_reason":"Debug JSON sidecar and expand controls implemented in shared transcript UI.

Currently, there's no way to see aggregate failure rates per session or jump to specific errors in the transcript. The plugin only captures file changes for Write/Edit/Bash, missing success/failure outcomes for all other tools. When reviewing a session, it's hard to identify which tool calls failed and diagnose session problems.\n\n## Solution\n1. Add a PostToolUse hook (`.*`) for successful tool calls and a PostToolUseFailure hook (`.*`) for failed ones. Each calls a capture script that POSTs to a new endpoint. Keep existing file-capture hooks unchanged.\n2. Create a ToolCall Ash resource storing: session_id, tool_use_id, tool_name, is_error, error_content. Link to transcript via tool_use_id (Message already has this field — no line numbers needed).\n3. During transcript sync, extract tool_result messages and upsert ToolCall records, catching any missed by the plugin.\n4. Display aggregate tool call stats (total, failed) per session in the dashboard table.\n5. In session view, add an Errors section listing failed tool calls. Click jumps to the matching Message in the transcript (found via tool_use_id).\n\n## Acceptance Tests\n- GIVEN a session with 50 tool calls (5 failures) WHEN PostToolUse and PostToolUseFailure hooks fire THEN 50 ToolCall records created with correct is_error flags\n- GIVEN a synced transcript WHEN sync runs THEN ToolCall records created for all tool_result messages\n- GIVEN dashboard with sessions WHEN page loads THEN each row shows X calls (Y failed)\n- GIVEN session view with 3 failed tool calls WHEN Errors section loads THEN 3 error entries shown with tool names and error snippets\n- GIVEN user clicks error entry WHEN clicked THEN transcript panel scrolls to the matching message and highlights it\n- GIVEN plugin POST fails WHEN hook executes THEN hook exits 0 and doesnt block Claude\n\n## Rabbit Holes\n- Parsing complex tool_result content structures (stick to simple is_error boolean + first 500 chars of error text)\n- Handling duplicate tool calls from plugin vs sync (upsert on tool_use_id)\n\n## No-gos\n- No retry logic for tool calls\n- No filtering by tool type in UI (show all errors)\n- No real-time updates (sync + plugin hooks only)\n- No authentication/authorization\n\n---\nRig: spotter.

The popup must target the exact pane that emitted the waiting signal and be dismissable by any key. The popup content is a concise summary generated server-side with AshAi using a configurable Haiku model.\n\nThe implementation must keep hook scripts non-blocking: hook scripts only schedule/cancel lightweight background work, while transcript reading and LLM summarization happen in Spotter server code.\n\n## Acceptance Tests\n- GIVEN Claude emits a waiting/idle notification for a pane WHEN 300 seconds pass without cancellation THEN a popup is shown on that exact pane.\n- GIVEN the popup is shown WHEN any key is pressed THEN the popup closes immediately.\n- GIVEN a popup is shown THEN popup width equals pane width and popup height equals configured overlay height (default 16).\n- GIVEN summary generation is requested THEN input is built from conversation start and end within configurable budget (default 4000 token-equivalent chars) and returned as compact text.\n- GIVEN summarization fails (parse error/model error/timeout) THEN a deterministic fallback summary is returned and popup still renders.\n\n## Rabbit Holes\n- Overfitting waiting detection to fragile string parsing in notification payloads.\n- Blocking hook path with expensive shell/HTTP calls.\n- Race conditions from repeated notifications for the same pane/session.\n- Popups appearing on wrong pane/client due to target misuse.\n\n## No-gos\n- Do not add Codex support in this epic.\n- Do not run heavy transcript parsing/LLM calls inside hook execution path.\n- Do not introduce backward-compat fallback layers beyond current greenfield architecture.\n\n---\nRig: spotter.\nAppetite: reviewed.\nTarget: spotter-plugin/hooks, spotter-plugin/scripts, lib/spotter_web/controllers, lib/spotter/services, config, test.\nArchitecture: Ash + Phoenix + tmux CLI integration, silent-fail plugin hooks, configurable runtime env.\nSources: spotter-plugin/hooks/hooks.json, spotter-plugin/scripts/notify-session.sh, lib/spotter_web/controllers/session_hook_controller.ex, lib/spotter/services/session_registry.ex, lib/spotter/services/tmux.ex, lib/spotter/transcripts/jsonl_parser.ex.\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"marco.rotili@handgemacht.ai","created_at":"2026-02-12T16:22:11.021854554+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili","updated_at":"2026-02-12T16:46:06.70402698+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-12T16:46:06.70402698+01:00","close_reason":"All 3 subtasks complete: hook orchestration, summary endpoint, and tests. 376 tests pass, 0 credo issues."}

Meanwhile Claude already has better resume metadata (`customTitle`, `summary`, `firstPrompt`) in `~/.claude/projects/*/sessions-index.json`, but Spotter does not ingest or display it.\n\n## Solution\n1. Ingest resume metadata from `sessions-index.json` during transcript sync and persist it on `sessions` rows.\n2. Make session start/end timestamp extraction robust by using first/last non-nil message timestamp with safe fallbacks.\n3. Update dashboard rendering so session name/description are human-friendly and `Started` is deterministic and readable.\n4. Add regression tests for metadata parsing, fallback precedence, and timestamp reliability.\n\n## Acceptance Tests\n- GIVEN a transcript directory with `sessions-index.json` entries WHEN sync runs THEN matching `sessions` rows store `custom_title`, `summary`, and `first_prompt`.\n- GIVEN a session whose first JSONL line has no timestamp WHEN parsed THEN `started_at` equals the first non-nil message timestamp.\n- GIVEN directories without `sessions-index.json` WHEN sync runs THEN sync completes without errors and existing fallback labels still render.\n- GIVEN `custom_title` exists WHEN dashboard renders THEN session label uses `custom_title` instead of slug/id.\n- GIVEN `custom_title` is nil and `summary` exists WHEN dashboard renders THEN session label uses `summary`.\n- GIVEN all optional label fields are nil WHEN dashboard renders THEN fallback remains slug then short session id.\n- GIVEN parsed `started_at` is nil but an existing row has `started_at` WHEN sync updates THEN existing `started_at` is not overwritten with nil.\n\n## Rabbit Holes\n- Not every project directory has `sessions-index.json` (must be optional, not required).\n- `summary` and `firstPrompt` can be very long and include command payloads; rendering needs truncation.\n- Existing rows may already have `started_at` from hook stubs; sync must not regress them.\n- Parsing must remain fast: avoid rereading index file per transcript.\n\n## No-gos\n- Do not call any external Claude API.\n- Do not add full-text search or ranking.\n- Do not redesign unrelated dashboard layout/actions.\n- Do not add per-row filesystem reads in LiveView render path.\n\n---\nAppetite: reviewed.

That repeated write/edit activity is a strong rework signal (often caused by linter/test feedback) and is currently invisible in both the session detail and dashboard.\n\n## Solution\nAdd transcript-derived rework tracking as a first-class persisted record:\n1. Define a `SessionRework` Ash resource for each repeated file modification event (second+ successful modification of the same file in one session).\n2. During transcript sync, compute rework via a running aggregate over parsed messages (Write/Edit tool_use + matching successful tool_result), then bulk upsert rework records.\n3. In session detail, render a Rework panel that lists identified rework entries and supports click-to-jump into the transcript.\n4. In dashboard, show per-session rework count.\n\n## Acceptance Tests\n- GIVEN a transcript where `lib/foo.ex` is modified 3 times successfully in one session WHEN sync runs THEN 2 `SessionRework` records exist for that file (occurrence indexes 2 and 3)\n- GIVEN a failed/rejected Write/Edit tool_result WHEN sync runs THEN no rework record is produced for that failed attempt\n- GIVEN a session with rework entries WHEN Session detail renders THEN Rework panel shows file path + occurrence count and each item is clickable\n- GIVEN user clicks a rework item WHEN click event fires THEN transcript scrolls to the matching tool_use line and row highlight is applied briefly\n- GIVEN dashboard session rows WHEN page renders THEN each row shows rework count derived from persisted `SessionRework` records\n- GIVEN sync is re-run for same transcript WHEN upsert executes THEN rework records are not duplicated\n\n## Rabbit Holes\n- Tool payload shape differences (`content` map vs list, missing tool_use_id, partial tool results) can break naive extraction\n- File path normalization across absolute paths, cwd-relative paths, and missing cwd can over/under-count rework\n- Jump behavior currently relies on JS hooks; event wiring must be explicit and resilient when terminal connection is delayed\n\n## No-gos\n- No retrospective inference from git commits or file snapshots for this feature (derive from transcript parse only)\n- No cross-session or cross-project rework aggregation in this epic\n- No scoring/weighting of rework severity beyond integer count and occurrence index\n\n---\nRig: spotter.

That table is in-memory and lost on node restart. Existing tmux sessions are not reconciled from tmux itself, so orphaned review sessions survive indefinitely.\n\n## Output Files\n- `lib/spotter/services/tmux.ex`\n- `lib/spotter/services/review_session_registry.ex`\n- `lib/spotter_web/live/pane_list_live.ex`\n- `test/spotter/services/review_session_registry_test.exs`\n- `test/spotter_web/live/pane_list_live_test.exs` (create if missing)\n\n## Implementation Spec\n1. Add tmux session introspection in `Spotter.Services.Tmux`.\n- Add `list_sessions/0` that returns all tmux sessions with at least:\n  - `session_name`\n  - `session_created`\n  - `session_activity`\n  - `session_attached`\n- Add `list_review_sessions/0` that filters names with prefix `spotter-review-`.\n\n2. Extend `ReviewSessionRegistry` sweep to reconcile orphans.\n- Keep existing ETS stale-heartbeat eviction behavior.\n- During each `:sweep`, also inspect `Tmux.list_review_sessions/0`.\n- For each review session from tmux:\n  - If ETS has fresh heartbeat (`now - heartbeat \u003c= @ttl`), keep it.\n  - If ETS is missing and tmux activity is older than `@ttl`, kill session.\n  - If ETS heartbeat is stale, kill session and delete ETS row.\n- Never crash registry if tmux query fails; continue and reschedule sweep.\n\n3. Remove launch race in `PaneListLive` review flow.\n- Replace fire-and-forget `Task.start(fn -\u003e Tmux.launch_review_session(...) end)` with direct launch handling.\n- On `{:ok, _name}`, keep current navigation behavior.\n- On `{:error, reason}`, stay on page and flash error.\n\n4. Logging/observability.\n- When a sweep kills a session, emit a log with session name and reason (`stale_heartbeat` or `orphan_inactive`).\n\n## Test Requirements\n1. `ReviewSessionRegistry` tests:\n- Orphan review session (not in ETS) with old tmux activity gets killed.\n- Orphan review session with recent activity is retained.\n- Stale ETS row + existing tmux session gets killed and ETS entry removed.\n- Tmux failure during sweep does not crash the GenServer.\n\n2. `PaneListLive` tests:\n- Review launch success path still navigates to `/sessions/:session_id`.\n- Review launch failure path sets flash and does not navigate.\n\n## Definition of Done\n- Reproduce cleanup behavior manually:\n  - Start review session, disconnect UI, wait \u003e30s, verify `spotter-review*` tmux session is gone.\n  - Restart Spotter while review sessions exist; wait one sweep cycle and verify old inactive review sessions are removed.\n- `mix test` passes.\n- `mix credo --strict` passes.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"marco.rotili@handgemacht.ai","created_at":"2026-02-12T15:49:51.077214573+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili","updated_at":"2026-02-12T15:55:52.154734367+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-12T15:55:52.154734367+01:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

{"id":"spotter-y5l","title":"Link Annotations to Claude Code Session IDs","description":"## Problem\nAnnotations are tied to ephemeral tmux pane_id values like \"%16\". When a pane dies or tmux restarts, annotations become orphaned. We can't correlate annotations with Claude Code sessions or transcripts.\n\n## Solution\nUse a **Claude Code plugin** to notify Spotter of {session_id, pane_id} mappings. The plugin uses a `hooks.json` to declare a SessionStart hook that reads session_id from stdin JSON and $TMUX_PANE from environment, then POSTs to a Phoenix endpoint. Annotations switch from pane_id to session_id as their key.\n\nComponents:\n1. Plugin directory (`spotter-plugin/`) with `hooks.json` + `scripts/notify-session.sh` — POSTs session_id + pane_id to Spotter\n2. Phoenix endpoint (/api/hooks/session-start) — receives and stores the mapping\n3. Schema migration — annotations: replace pane_id with session_id\n4. PaneViewLive — resolve session_id via stored mapping, use for annotation CRUD\n5. scripts/setup_worktree.sh — add `--plugin-dir` flag to claude command (no per-worktree hook copying)\n\n### Plugin Structure\n```\nspotter-plugin/\n├── hooks.json          # Declares SessionStart hook\n└── scripts/\n    └── notify-session.sh  # POSTs session_id + pane_id to Spotter\n```\n\n### Why plugin over bare hooks?\n- Single directory, shared by all worktrees via `--plugin-dir` CLI flag\n- Multiple lifecycle events in one `hooks.json` (extensible for Stop, PostToolUse, etc.)\n- ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} for portable script paths\n- No per-worktree file copying needed\n\n## Acceptance Tests\n- GIVEN Claude Code starts in a tmux pane WHEN SessionStart hook fires THEN Spotter receives session_id + pane_id mapping\n- GIVEN a stored mapping WHEN PaneViewLive mounts for that pane THEN it resolves the session_id\n- GIVEN annotation created with session_id WHEN pane dies and restarts with same session (resume) THEN annotation still loads\n- GIVEN a new worktree WHEN setup_worktree.sh runs THEN claude command includes --plugin-dir flag\n\n## Rabbit Holes\n- Hook script must be async (non-blocking) to not slow Claude startup\n- Server might not be running when hook fires — script should fail silently\n- Session resume vs new session — both fire SessionStart, mapping should upsert\n- Pane ID stability: tmux pane IDs are stable for the pane lifetime but change on pane recreation. The SessionStart hook fires on every start AND resume, so mapping self-heals.\n\n## No-gos\n- No PID/file heuristics for session detection (plugin solves this cleanly)\n- No migration of existing pane_id annotations (clean slate)\n- No error-tracking hooks yet (future work)\n\n---\nRig: spotter.

{"id":"spotter-ybf","title":"Anchor-Based Transcript Sync (replace per-scroll server roundtrip)","description":"## Problem\n\nTranscript-terminal scroll sync currently fires a server roundtrip on every scroll event. The handle_event(\"terminal_scrolled\") in session_live.ex (line 164) receives visible_text from the JS hook, splits it into lines, trims each one, and does a linear substring search across all rendered_lines via find_matching_message/2 (line 264) and match_line_to_message/2 (line 272). This is fragile in three ways: (1) it sends up to ~80 lines of terminal text over the WebSocket on every 300ms debounce tick, (2) String.contains?/2 matching produces false positives when short common strings appear in multiple messages, and (3) the search is O(visible_lines * rendered_lines) per scroll event with no caching.\n\n## Solution\n\nReplace the per-scroll server roundtrip with a precomputed breakpoint map. On mount, the backend walks rendered transcript lines top-to-bottom consuming matches from the terminal buffer, finds anchor points where transcript content can be reliably identified in the terminal output, interpolates between anchors to cover gaps, and produces a breakpoint map: a sorted list of %{t: terminal_line, id: message_id}. This map is pushed to the JS client once. The client then does instant local binary search on scroll — no server call needed.\n\nThe algorithm:\n1. Strip ANSI codes and trailing spaces from terminal capture, split into lines.\n2. Walk rendered_lines top-to-bottom.\n3. For each rendered line, scan terminal_lines forward from a cursor position (max 50 lookahead).\n4. Match strategies by type priority: tool_use prefix match, user prompt text (\u003e10 chars substring), tool result prefix match, assistant text (\u003e30 chars substring).\n5. On match: record anchor, advance cursor past match.\n6. Between consecutive anchors: interpolate breakpoints proportionally to fill gaps.\n7. Emit final breakpoint_map containing only entries where message_id changes.\n\n## Acceptance Tests\n\n- GIVEN the tool_heavy.jsonl fixture WHEN TranscriptSync.build_breakpoint_map/2 runs THEN at least 3 anchors are found AND the breakpoint_map covers terminal lines from first anchor to last anchor AND every message_id in the map exists in the rendered_lines\n- GIVEN a breakpoint_map pushed to the client WHEN the user scrolls the terminal THEN the transcript panel highlights the correct message within 16ms (single frame) with zero server roundtrips\n- GIVEN no terminal content (pane_id is nil) WHEN mount runs THEN breakpoint_map is assigned as [] and no errors occur\n- GIVEN a breakpoint_map WHEN the user scrolls to a terminal line between two anchors THEN the interpolated message_id is the message that owns the proportional range between those anchors\n\n## Rabbit Holes\n\n- Perfect per-character fidelity in matching — approximate substring matching is fine\n- Bidirectional sync (click transcript to scroll terminal) — out of scope\n- Re-computing breakpoint map on live terminal output changes — defer, only compute on mount\n- Handling tmux pane resize mid-session — defer\n\n## No-gos\n\n- No changes to TranscriptRenderer — consume its output as-is\n- No changes to the terminal channel or tmux capture logic\n- No persistent storage of breakpoint maps (computed in-memory only)\n- No removal of the existing terminal_scrolled event handler — keep as fallback until proven stable\n\n---\nRig: spotter.

Template: add Ctrl+Shift+D hint near transcript header:\n   \u003cspan style=\"color: #444; font-size: 0.7em; margin-left: auto;\"\u003eCtrl+Shift+D: debug\u003c/span\u003e\n\n3. Template: for each transcript line div, if show_debug and line is anchored, show colored dot:\n   :tool_use → #f0c674 (yellow), :user → #7ec8e3 (blue), :result → #81c784 (green), :text → #ce93d8 (purple)\n   Plus the matched terminal line number in small text.\n\n4. JS: add handleEvent(\"debug_anchors\"):\n   this._debugAnchors = anchors\n\n5. JS: keyboard handler in mounted():\n   Ctrl+Shift+D → toggle this._showDebug, call this._renderDebugOverlay(), pushEvent(\"toggle_debug\")\n\n6. JS: _renderDebugOverlay():\n   When on: create/show absolute-positioned div over terminal with colored tick marks at anchor positions.\n   Legend: \"Anchors: N found\" with type counts.\n   When off: hide overlay.\n\n**Source references:**\n- lib/spotter_web/live/session_live.ex — template transcript panel (lines 336-346), push_event patterns\n- assets/js/app.js — handleEvent patterns, Terminal hook\n\n**Edge cases:**\n- No anchors → \"0 anchors\" legend, no markers\n- Toggle before data arrives → \"waiting for data\" message\n- Many anchors (\u003e100) → 2px markers fit comfortably\n\n**Definition of Done:**\n- All requirements implemented\n- Manual: Ctrl+Shift+D toggles overlay on/off\n- Manual: colored markers match actual anchor locations\n- Manual: debug off → no visual changes\n- mix credo --strict passes","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"marco.rotili@handgemacht.ai","created_at":"2026-02-11T20:37:12.65658612+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili","updated_at":"2026-02-11T21:18:45.17028503+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T21:18:45.17028503+01:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"spotter-ybf.4","depends_on_id":"spotter-ybf","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-11T20:37:12.658841774+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili"},{"issue_id":"spotter-ybf.4","depends_on_id":"spotter-ybf.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-11T20:37:17.217147701+01:00","created_by":"Marco Rotili"}]}
